    <description>At the start of the procedure, a straight vitrectomy knife will be inserted subdermally and will be slowly advanced parallel to the dermis.  Rapid advancement and retraction of the needle under the scarred area in a lancing motion will be performed to abrade the underside of the dermis followed by side to side sweeping motions attempting to break any fibrous attachments to the deeper tissues.</description>
