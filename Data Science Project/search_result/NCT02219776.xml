  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the use of a standard preoperative skin disinfectant prior to shoulder surgery
      propionibacterium acne remains a leading cause of post-operative infections.  The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate effectiveness of topical benzoyl peroxide as an adjuvant to
      chlorhexidine-impregnated skin preparation in attempting to lower the colonization
      propionibacterium acne prior to surgery.  This study will take cultures from patients who
      are randomly assigned into groups that receive and do not receive benzoyl peroxide as
      additional skin prep prior to elective shoulder surgery and compare quantified culture
      results.
