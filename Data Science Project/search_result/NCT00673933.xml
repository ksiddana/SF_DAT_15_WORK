      In this multicenter study, patients with dark skin and acne vulgaris will be included. The
      patients will receive treatment with MAL PDT and placebo PDT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment period started within 2 weeks of the study screen. Patients received two
      treatments (MAL PDT and vehicle PDT) to each of the treatment areas, 2 weeks apart, and were
      followed-up 4 weeks after last treatment. The total duration of the study was 6-8 weeks.

      Methyl aminolevulinate 80 mg/g cream (MAL cream 8%)and vehicle was applied for 1.5 hours
      before illumination (AktiliteÂ® CL128), total light dose 37 J/cm2
