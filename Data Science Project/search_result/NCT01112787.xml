      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the irritation level of tazarotene foam after 21
      days of exposure on the skin of healthy volunteers.

      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam to induce cutaneous irritation using a 21 day
      cumulative irritation assay in healthy adult volunteers.  Approximately 40 healthy male and
      female volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65 years will be enrolled.  All subjects will be
      exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam, vehicle foam, sodium lauryl sulfate 0.5%
      (positive control), and distilled water (negative control).  Each set of patches will be
      applied to the same randomized sites once daily for 21 days; patches will be removed after
      24 Â±1 hours and the patch sites will be evaluated for signs inflammatory skin responses (eg,
      erythema, edema, papules) and superficial effects.
