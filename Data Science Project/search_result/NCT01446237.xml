      This study is being conducted to obtain safety, efficacy, and satisfaction data on the
      combination of topical Benzoyl Peroxide (BPO) 2.5% and the topical keratolytic agent
      Salicylic Acid (SA) 0.5% in the treatment of moderate to severe acne. Subjects with moderate
      or severe acne will be asked to apply the commercially available, over-the-counter products
      Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% BPO), Foam Advanced Acne Treatment (2.5% BPO), and Foam
      Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% SA) daily for 12 weeks. No control group or reference treatment
      will be included.

      This open-label, multicenter, study is being conducted to obtain safety, efficacy, and
      satisfaction data on an Acne System (Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%, Salicylic Acid 0.5%), which
      includes Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Advanced Acne Treatment (2.5%
      Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner (0.5% Salicylic Acid), in the treatment of
      moderate to severe acne. Approximately 120 male or female subjects ages 12-35 years,
      inclusive, with moderate or severe acne as assessed by Investigator's Global Assessment
      (ISGA) and lesion counts are expected to be enrolled. Subjects will be instructed to use all
      3 study products as part of a complete acne treatment system; no reference therapy or
      control group will be included. Subjects will be instructed to apply Foam Deep Cleanser
      (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Advnced Acne Treatment (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) to the face
      each morning and Foam Deep Cleanser (2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide) and Foam Rejuvenating Toner
      (0.5% Salicylic Acid) each evening over an application period of 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary

          -  Male or female ages 12 to 35 years, inclusive at time of consent.

          -  ISGA score of 3 or 4 at Baseline.

          -  Lesion counts meeting all of the following criteria: A: A minimum of 25 but not more
             than 50 facial inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules), excluding nasal lesions.
             B: A minimum of 20 but not more than 100 facial non-inflammatory lesions (open and
             closed comedones), excluding nasal lesions. C: No more than 3 facial nodular lesions
             (&lt;5mm), with no cystic lesions.

          -  Ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled visits,
             and successfully complete the study.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential.

             tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, and sulfonamides) because of the
             possibility of augmented photosensitivity.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids on the face within the past 2 weeks or systemic
             corticosteroids within the past 4 weeks. Use of inhaled, intra-articular, or

             estrogens, as described above, androgens, or anti-androgenic agents for more than 12
             consecutive weeks prior to study enrollment are allowed to enroll as long as they do
             not expect to change the dose or drug, or to discontinue use during the study and it
             has not been indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

          -  Male with facial hair that could interfere with study assessments.

             antimicrobials, glycolic acid, abradants) within the past 2 weeks. Use of superficial
             facial procedures, and natural/herbal products within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Concomitant use of medications that are reported to exacerbate acne as these may
             impact efficacy assessments.

          -  Facial procedure (eg, blue light, chemical or laser peel, microdermabrasion)
             performed by aesthetician, beautician, physician, nurse, or other practitioner within

             of the study product.

          -  Any other condition which, in the judgement of the investigator, would put the
             subject at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

          -  Current drug or alcohol abuse. (Drug screening is not required.)

          -  Considered unable or unlikely to attend the necessary visits.
