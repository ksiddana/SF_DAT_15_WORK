      At the Baseline Visit, following satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures,
      all subjects will be applying two products to their faces, each on one side only.  The side
      of the face receiving each product is randomly assigned.  One group will use Retin-A MICRO
      Gel, (tretinoin) 0.04% Pump on the left side of the face and Epiduo Gel (adapalene .1% and
      benzoyl peroxide 2.5%), on the right side of the face daily for 3 consecutive weeks after
      washing with study-supplied facial wash.  The other group will use the same products, but on
      opposite sides of the face for three consecutive weeks after washing with the same
      study-supplied facial wash.

      Subjects will return to the study center every weekday morning for evaluation and
      application of both study products. Applications done on the weekends, will be done at home
      by the subject. At each visit the subject will be scored for cutaneous treatment effects by
      a blinded evaluator.  At baseline and at the end of each week, subjects will be photographed
      and have chromometer readings.
