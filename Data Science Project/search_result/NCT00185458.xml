  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed to look at the transfer from using LNG IUS for contraception
      only, in reproductive age to using it for endometrial protection in menopausal age. The main
      area of interest in the study is the pattern of any vaginal bleeding that occurs.

For outcome measures (vaginal bleeding variables), five 90-day Reference Periods were defined, which were used for comparison during statistical analysis: Reference Period -1 in Contraception Phase; Reference Periods 1-4 in HRT Phase. 90-day reference periods for analyzing vaginal bleeding data are defined by World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. Reference Period -1 is the last 90-day reference period that the subject had before starting the HRT. Reference Period 1 covers the first 90-days of the HRT phase, Reference Period 2 covers days 91 to 180, Reference Period 3 days 181 to 270, and Reference Period 4 days 271 to 360 of the HRT phase.</description>
