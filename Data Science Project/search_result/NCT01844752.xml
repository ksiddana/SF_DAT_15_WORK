  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week clinical trial in subjects with acne vulgaris.  Subjects will be
      randomized to NVN1000 1% Gel, NVN1000 4% Gel or Vehicle Gel twice daily.  Safety,
      tolerability and efficacy will be assessed over the course of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, evaluator and subject blinded, randomized, vehicle-controlled,
      parallel group, dose-ranging study to be conducted in approximately 150 subjects with acne
      vulgaris. Subjects who satisfy the entry criteria at the Baseline visit will be randomized
      to NVN1000 1% Gel, NVN1000 4% Gel or Vehicle Gel in a 1:1:1 ratio.   Efficacy assessments
      will include inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts and investigator global
      assessments (IGA).  Tolerability and safety assessments include cutaneous tolerability
      evaluation, adverse event collection, physical exams, and laboratory studies. Subjects will
      return for post-baseline evaluation at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.
