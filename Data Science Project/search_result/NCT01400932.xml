    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study
      in Japanese subjects with acne vulgaris to demonstrate the efficacy of GI148512 (benzoyl
      peroxide [BPO] 3% gel) when applied once daily for 12 weeks.  This study will also evaluate
      the safety of GI148512 when applied topically once daily for 12 weeks.

      Main inclusion criteria will be 12 to 45 years of age, who have an Investigator Static
      Global Assessment (ISGA) score of 2 or greater at baseline visit, and have both 17 to 60
      facial inflammatory lesions (papules plus pustules) and 20 to 150 facial non-inflammatory
      lesions (open and closed comedones), including nasal lesions.  The primary objective is to
      demonstrate the superiority of GI148512 to vehicle gel in total lesion counts.  The
      secondary objectives are to demonstrate the superiority of GI148512 to vehicle gel in
      inflammatory lesion counts, and to evaluate the efficacy of GI148512 compared with vehicle
      gel at each visit. A total of 360 subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of
      the groups.

    <description>The investigator (or subinvestigator) counted all inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodular lesions) and non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedos; diagnosis based on palpation) on the face at each study visit. An open comedo is an open, widely dilated follicle with black-colored sebum, due to melanin and oxidation, and keratinous material that forms a plug, thereby obstructing the pilosebaceous duct. A closed comedo is a closed follicle filled with impacted sebum covered by keratin that has a whitish color. A papule is a small, raised, red, dome-shaped palpable lesion. A pustule is a raised, dome-shaped palpable lesion containing yellow fluid (pus). A nodule may be a raised or deep-seated, dome-shaped palpable lesion of at least 5 millimeters in diameter.</description>
