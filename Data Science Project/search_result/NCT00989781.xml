    <textblock>
      Jeffrey Chang MD is conducting a research study to learn more about the increased male
      hormone levels, otherwise known as androgens, seen in women with polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS).  Women with PCOS have ovaries that are comprised of many cysts, or follicles.  They
      also have irregular or absent menstrual periods and symptoms of increased male hormones,
      such as facial hair or acne.  In each part of the study (except part 4 which is for PCOS
      women only) we will be comparing responses of PCOS women to normal controls

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first part of this study looks specifically at the structure of the ovaries, which are
      the female sex glands where both androgens and estrogens (female hormones) are made.  It
      involves imaging your ovaries with a technology called 3-D Ultrasound.  We are interested in
      recording the number, size and arrangement of the follicles in your ovaries.

      The second part of the study looks at how the ovary produces male hormones, or androgens,
      with and without follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation.  Hormones are substances
      made by a gland in one part of the body which regulate another part.  FSH is a hormone
      naturally produced by the pituitary gland located in the brain and it helps the ovary
      produce estrogens, or female hormones.  LH is a hormone also naturally produced by the
      pituitary gland and it has the ability to stimulate the ovary to make androgens.  We are
      interested to see how much androgen your ovaries will produce in response to LH with and
      without FSH.  To accomplish this, you will be given FSH as well as hCG, a drug that acts
      like LH to stimulate the ovary; FSH and hCG are approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for this investigational, off-label use.

      The third part of the study looks at how much the adrenal glands contribute to the increase
      male hormone levels seen in PCOS.  ACTH is a hormone naturally produced by the pituitary
      gland located in the brain and it stimulates the adrenals to make hormones.  The adrenal
      glands are above the kidneys.  They are chiefly responsible for helping the body adjust to
      stressful situations and work by producing cortisol and adrenaline.  The adrenal glands also
      produce androgens, or male hormones.  Previous studies have shown that some women with PCOS
      produce more male hormones from their adrenals.  We are interested to see how much androgen
      your adrenal glands produce.  To accomplish this, you will first be given dexamethasone, a
      stress steroid, to temporarily suppress your adrenal glands.  You will then be given ACTH
      intravenously over the course of 7 hours to stimulate your adrenal glands.

      The fourth part of the study is for PCOS women only and looks at how much the role of
      insulin contributes to the increase male hormone levels.  Insulin is a hormone naturally
      produced by the pancreas that stimulates all of the cells in your body to take up glucose,
      or sugar, from the blood.  Previous studies have shown that PCOS women who are more
      resistant to insulin, or whose cells do not take up glucose from the blood in response to
      insulin, make more male hormones.  We are interested to see how much androgen your ovaries
      produce in response to LH before and after we temporarily decrease the amount of insulin in
      your blood.  To accomplish this, you will again be given hCG, a drug that acts like LH to
      stimulate the ovary, with and without diazoxide, a drug that decreases the amount of insulin
      in your bloodstream.  These tests will all be done after you are on a diet that limits how
      much sugar you eat.  To test how much insulin you make, you will also be given Oral Glucose
      Tolerance Tests before and after diazoxide.  This test is done by drinking a sugary liquid
      and testing your blood over 3 hours.

    <description>Each subject will undergo pelvic 3D ultrasound followed by an iv recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (r-hCG) stimulation test. One month later the r-hCG test will be repeated 24 hr after an injection of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).
After 1 month, subjects will receive a 7 hr dose-response infusion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) with blood sampling. Dexamethasone will be given prior to ACTH.
After 1 month, subject will receive r-hCG as described above followed the next day by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Subsequently, subjects will take Diazoxide 3 times a day for 2 weeks. At weekly intervals (2 weeks), the r-hCG stimulation test will be repeated followed the next day by an OGTT as described above.</description>
