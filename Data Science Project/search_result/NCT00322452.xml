  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare gefitinib with carboplatin / paclitaxel doublet
      chemotherapy given as first line treatment in terms of progression free survival in selected
      NSCLC patients with the objective of demonstrating non-inferiority.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour assessments as per RECIST were performed at baseline and then every 42 days ± 7 days from randomization until data cut off (14th April 2008).</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PFS was defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the date of objective disease progression (as per RECIST) or the date of death (from any cause) in the absence of objective disease progression. The median PFS in months is presented here.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Overall Survival (OS) in Months at OS Data Cut Off (14th June 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>Following the PFS DCO on 14th April 2008 information on survival status was collected every 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Overall Survival was assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant was known to have died, the time to death was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant was censored at the last date they were known to be alive. Median Overall Survival in months is presented here.</description>
