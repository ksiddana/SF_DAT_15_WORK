    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of YAZ (drospirenone 3 mg /
      ethinylestradiol 20 µg) in comparison with placebo in female patients with moderate acne
      vulgaris over 6 treatment cycles.

    <description>Acne lesions were counted by the trained designee over the entire face. All types of lesions were to be identified and separately counted, i.e., non-inflammatory open and closed comedones, and inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules. The percent change from Cycle 6 to Baseline was calculated as (total lesion count at Baseline - total lesion count at Cycle 6)/(total lesion count at Baseline)*100, so that improvement is indicated by a larger percent change.</description>
