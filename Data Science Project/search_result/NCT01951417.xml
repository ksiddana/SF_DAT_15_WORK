  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study to be conducted in the United States. The study
      will examine the change in lesion count in subjects using Epiduo® Gel Pump (once daily) in
      conjunction with Cetaphil® DermaControl™  Foam Wash (twice daily) and Moisturizer SPF 30
      (once daily). Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of mild or moderate acne who are eligible
      for treatment with Epiduo® in accordance with the currently approved product labeling and
      who meet other inclusion/exclusion criteria are to be enrolled in the study and receive the
      study products for 8 weeks. Efficacy and safety assessments include: complete lesion counts,
      cutaneous irritation assessment, end of study treatment questionnaire, photographic
      evaluation for oiliness, skin tone, and P Acnes, hydration assessment, barrier function
      assessment, treatment compliance, and adverse event assessment.
