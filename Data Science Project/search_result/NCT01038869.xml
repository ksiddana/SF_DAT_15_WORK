  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residual post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)from acne is disturbing to  individuals
      with skin of color. Finacea has been anecdotally known to be beneficial in resolving PIH
      related to acne vulgaris. However, it has not been clinically tested for this purpose. The
      current study will investigate the efficacy and safety of Finacea in the treatment of acne
      vulgaris and PIH.
