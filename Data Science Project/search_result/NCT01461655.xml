    <description>The investigator made an assessment of the disease severity (Plaque thickening, Scaling and Erythema) using a 6-point scale (Clear, Almost clear, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Very severe).
The outcome was the proportion of &quot;success&quot; (improvement of two grades of the IGA) from baseline to the end of treatment</description>
