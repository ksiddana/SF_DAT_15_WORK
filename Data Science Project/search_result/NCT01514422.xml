      The purpose of this study is to evaluate minocycline as a potential treatment for bipolar
      depression when added to a mood-stabilizing medication. Minocycline is an antibiotic that is
      approved for the treatment of infections and acne. Participation in this research study is
      expected to last 8 weeks, and includes five outpatient visits.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar depression remains the great unmet need in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Only
      two treatments have been FDA-approved for the management of acute bipolar depression (the
      combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine and quetiapine). Early pilot data suggests the drug
      minocycline has potent antidepressant effects. Minocycline is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) (for acne and bacterial infections), is inexpensive and readily
      available in generic formulation, and is generally well-tolerated. This study will examine
      whether administering the drug minocycline to individuals with bipolar depression over 8
      weeks will improve their depressive symptoms. This study will also offer an option to
      participate in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure N-Acetylaspartate
      (NAA) levels in the brain, which are thought to be decreased in bipolar disorder.
