      A 12-week evaluation of the safety and efficacy of dapsone gel 5% when used with tretinoin
      gel 0.025% compared with tretinoin gel 0.025% monotherapy in treating moderate to severe
      facial acne vulgaris

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion Counts (Papules, Pustules and Nodules) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts (papules, pustules and nodules) at week 12.  Papules and nodules are round, solid elevations of the skin with no visible fluid; papules are smaller (less than 5 or 10 millimeters in width and depth) and nodules are larger (greater than 5 or 10 millimeters in width and depth).  Pustules are small elevations of the skin containing cloudy material. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Investigator Global Assessment at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline in the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) at week 12.  The IGA is a 5-point scale used by the investigator to assess overall acne severity, where 0 equals clear skin (no evidence of acne) and 4 equals severe acne.  A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in acne severity (improvement).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overall Disease Severity at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline in overall disease severity at week 12.  The overall disease severity was evaluated by the investigator using a 7-point scale to rate the overall acne severity (lesions, inflammation, facial redness and skin condition), where 0=no acne lesions and 6=most severe acne.  A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in overall acne disease severity (improvement).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts (Open and Closed Comedones) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts (open/closed comedones) at week 12.  Comedones are small bumps on the skin (lesions) caused by acne and found at the opening of a skin pore.  Open comedones (also known as a blackheads) have a microscopic opening to the skin surface, while closed comedones (also known as whiteheads or &quot;pimples&quot;) lack the opening to the skin.  A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>
