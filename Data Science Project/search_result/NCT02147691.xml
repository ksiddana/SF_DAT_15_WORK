  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study will investigate whether combination treatment of Finacea 15% Gel and
      Brimonidine 0.33% Gel could be more effective than Brimonidine 0.33%  Gel monotherapy in
      treating both the papules/pustules and erythema associated with rosacea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease with different components including
      inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules), erythema and telangiectasia. Brimonidine 0.33% Gel
      primarily affects the erythematous components of rosacea. As such, combination treatment
      with a standard rosacea treatment, such as Finacea 15% Gel, may provide additional relief
      for the inflammatory component of rosacea.
