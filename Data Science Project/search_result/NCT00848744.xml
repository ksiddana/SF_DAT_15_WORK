    <textblock>
      This study is a split face, paired-comparison, pilot study of at least 10 subjects to
      complete. Participants in this study will be patients seen at Children's Memorial Hospital,
      who are clinically diagnosed with mild to moderate acne vulgaris.  Participants will be
      recruited from one of the clinics, as well as from previous IRB approved acne studies housed
      in the Department of Dermatology. All subjects accrued from previous studies have agreed to
      be contacted for further investigations.   Subjects 13 to 35 years of age with mild to
      moderate acne vulgaris symmetrical in appearance on both sides of the face, and meeting
      inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate

      Acne vulgaris is a follicular disorder occurring in pilosebaceous units in the skin of the
      face, neck, and upper trunk. These sebaceous follicles have follicular channels and adjacent
      multiacinar sebaceous glands. In the lubrication process of normal skin, sebum travels
      through the follicular canal to the skin surface, carrying along with it desquamated cells
      from follicular epithelium. Acne develops when these specialized follicles undergo
      pathologic alterations that result in the formation of non-inflammatory lesions (comedones)
      and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules)1.

      The basic cause of acne remains unknown, but its manifestations are thought to be the
      product of four pathogenic events: 1) increased sebum production fueled by androgenic
      stimulation in the pubertal period; 2) obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit due to an
      abnormal keratinization process; 3) proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, an anaerobic
      diphtheroid normally residing in pilosebaceous follicles; and 4) inflammation that is
      mediated both by the action of chemotactic factors and various enzymes, and initiated in
      part by the interaction of P. acnes with toll-like receptors. Impaction of the pilosebaceous
      follicle gives rise to the microcomedo that is thought to be the precursor lesion of acne1.

      Topical salicylic acid is a common and well-established agent with known keratolytic
      properties used in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  The safety profile for topical salicylic
      acid has been well delineated. The most common side effects attributed to salicylic acid
      products include irritation, dryness, scaling, burning and stinging.

      Salicylic acid 1.0% creams (Formulation A and Formulation B) will be evaluated to detect any
      differences in their response for safety and efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects who are 13 to 35 years of age.

          2. Subjects are in good health and are free of any other facial skin disorders that may
             interfere with acne study assessments.

          3. Subjects have the willingness and ability to understand and provide informed
             assent/consent to participate in the study and are able to communicate with the
             investigator. Subjects are willing and able to follow all study directions and to
             commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study. In addition, subjects
             must be willing to accept the restrictions of the study.
