  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical trial are to compare the quality of life of the subjects,
      the efficacy and the tolerance of Duac® Gel (gel formulation with a combination of
      clindamycin phosphate [equivalent to 1% clindamycin] and 5% benzoyl peroxide), applied once
      daily, against Differin® Gel (gel with 0.1% adapalene), used once daily, in the treatment of
      mild to moderate acne vulgaris.

      Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit. It is
      characterized by the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, maculae and
      scars, generally located on the face, chest and back. Acne pathogenesis is recognized as
      multifactorial.

      Acne vulgaris is the most common dermatological disorder. It affects approximately 85%
      individuals at some point in their lives, generally between 12 and 24 years of age. Although
      acne is prevalent within this age range, it can persist for many years and its long-term
      physical and psychological implications can be significant.

      There are several medicinal products used to treat acne. However, the therapeutic challenge
      remains, therefore it is essential to continue investigating effective strategies for the
      treatment of this disease.

    <description>Skindex-29 is a self-administered QoL questionnaire comprised of 29 items scored on a 5-point scale (0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=all the time) covering 3 domains: emotional (10 items), symptomatic (7 items), and functional (12 items), with domain scores ranging from 0 to 40, 28, and 48, respectively. Lower scores = better QoL. A Global Score (range 0-100) was derived by multiplying the sum of the points for all 29 items by a constant (0.862). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 2 minus the value at Baseline (Week 0).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Lesions were counted on the entire face (defined as the area from the upper part of the jaw to the lower part of the hairline), excluding maculae and non-inflammatory lesions located on the nose or chin. Inflammatory lesions included papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. Non-inflammatory lesions included closed comedones (whiteheads) and open comedones (blackheads). The total lesion count was calculated as the sum of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. Change from Baseline was calculated as the values at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 minus the value at Baseline (Week 0).</description>

    <description>Lesions were counted on the entire face (defined as the area from the upper part of the jaw to the lower part of the hairline), excluding maculae and non-inflammatory lesions located on the nose or chin. Inflammatory lesions (IL) included papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. Non-inflammatory lesions (NIL) included closed comedones (whiteheads) and open comedones (blackheads). Total lesion count was calculated as the sum of IL and NIL. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the values at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 minus the value at Baseline divided by Baseline value * 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 2</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Analyses were performed to determine whether there was a correlation between the total lesion count and either the global or subdomain Skindex-29 questionnaire scores. Correlations between the Skindex-29 questionnaire scores and total lesion count from Baseline to Week 2 were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients, which ranges from -1 to 1. A score of 0 denotes no correlation, a score approaching 1 denotes correlation, and a score approaching -1 denotes inverse correlation.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Global change in acne improvement was assessed by the investigator on a 7-point scale: 1=greatly worsened, 2=significantly worsened, 3=slightly worsened, 4=no change, 5=slightly improved, 6=significantly improved, or 7=greatly improved. Global change at the indicated week was assessed in terms of change from the previous week. Change at Week 2, for example, was an assessment of change from Week 1.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The acne grade on the participant's face was assessed by the investigator using the LRAG, a photographic scale allowing for the assessment of the clinical status for acne severity for the face, back, and chest. It consists of a 12-grade scale (1, least severe; 12, most severe) for inflammatory visible lesions (les.).  For non-inflammatory les., this scale comprises 3 photos of les. of increasing severity (grades 1-3). The scale provides a qualitative assessment of superficial/visible les. and provides consistency and inter-/intra-rater reliability. Grading was performed prior to les. counting.</description>
