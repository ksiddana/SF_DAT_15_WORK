  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multi-center, open label, active-comparator study to compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of Doryx Delayed Release Tablets to doxycycline hyclate in patients with
      moderate to severe acne vulgaris.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of Doryx Delayed Release Tablets to doxycycline hyclate will be assessed using an
      Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score and the absolute change from baseline to 12
      weeks in inflammatory lesion count in patients with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris.
       Additionally, the absolute change from baseline to 12 weeks in non-inflammatory lesions
      count of Doryx Delayed Release Tablets compared to doxycycline hyclate will be evaluated.

    <description>The Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) was performed at baseline and at 12 weeks. The IGA score is based on a 5-point acne severity scale from zero (clear) to 4 (severe). Successful outcome is at least a 2-point reduction in IGA score from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Acne lesions fall into 2 groups: inflammatory and non-inflammatory. The number of inflammatory acne lesions on the face was measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. The difference (change) was calculated.</description>
