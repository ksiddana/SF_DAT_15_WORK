    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind (blinded expert grader) study that will enroll 25-30 healthy
      volunteers without facial acne.  On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of the 2
      test products, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide 5% or clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl
      peroxide 2.5% and the other side of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind (blinded expert grader), parallel group, randomized, half-face study
      being conducted at one clinical site. On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of the
      2 test products, clindamycin  and benzoyl peroxide 5%) or clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide
      2.5%) and the other side of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control.
      Approximately 25-30 male and female healthy subjects without facial acne, aged 18 to 45,
      will be randomly assigned to each product.

      The eligible subjects (screened 3 days prior to randomization) who qualify will be entered
      into a 2-week treatment phase. The once-daily applications for the clindamycin  and benzoyl
      peroxide 5%and clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%) will be supervised at the
      site, Monday through Friday of each week.  Subjects will apply the study product at home on
      Saturdays and Sundays and record the times of application on a diary card.

      A blinded expert grader will rate comparative product tolerance in terms of erythema and
      dryness on each week day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) during the study before study
      product is applied.

      Instruments will be used to measure transepidermal water loss (TEWL) to assess skin moisture
      in order to evaluate product mildness. Instrumentation measurements of skin surface
      conductance will be utilized to evaluate product performance in terms of level of skin
      hydration.

      Subjects will complete questionnaires and all adverse events will be recorded.

    <description>To assess skin moisture and hydration using transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Results are measured on a continuous scale as grams per meters squared (m^2) per hour.  Higher values indicate greater water loss/ lower skin moisture levels.
Evaporative water loss measurements provide an instrumental assessment of skin barrier function(one of the layers of the skin.    Damage leads to a disruption of the barrier that is accompanied by elevated water loss rates and affects skin moisture and hydration.</description>

    <description>The ability of an alternating current to flow through the stratum corneum is an indirect measure of its water content.  The value recorded is expressed in microsiemens. Higher values indicate greater levels of skin hydration.
Test results were compared to measurements from the other side of the face, which was not treated instead of referring to a normal range.  A normal range does not exist for this measurement.  Instead, the non-treated side of the face was used as a control to determine the normal level of skin hydration.</description>
