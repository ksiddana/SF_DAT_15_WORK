    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least a One Point Decrease in the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>GAAS was conducted by the investigator at Baseline and Week 12. The patient's facial acne was evaluated on a 5 point scale 0=None (no evidence of acne), 1=Minimal (few lesions), 2=Mild (several to many non-inflammatory lesions; few inflammatory lesions), 3=Moderate (many lesions) to 4=Severe (Significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules present, few nodulo-cystic lesions; comedones may be present). Papules/nodules are round, solid elevations of the skin with no visible fluid. The percentage of participants with at least a one point decrease (improvement) in GAAS was calculated.</description>

Papules and nodules are round, solid elevations of the skin with no visible fluid. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants at Week 12 Having at Least a One Point Decrease in Overall Disease Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The overall disease severity was evaluated by the investigator at Baseline and Week 12 using a 7-point scale to rate the overall acne severity (lesions, inflammation, facial redness and skin condition), where 0=no acne lesions and 6=most severe acne. The percentage of participants with at least a one point decrease (improvement) from baseline is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Percent Change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts (papules, pustules and nodules) at week 12. Papules and nodules are round, solid elevations of the skin with no visible fluid; papules are smaller (less than 5 or 10 millimeters in width and depth) and nodules are larger (greater than 5 or 10 millimeters in width and depth). Pustules are small elevations of the skin containing cloudy material. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Non-inflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Percent Change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts (open/closed comedones) at week 12. Comedones are small bumps on the skin (lesions) caused by acne and found at the opening of a skin pore. Open comedones (also known as a blackheads) have a microscopic opening to the skin surface, while closed comedones (also known as whiteheads or &quot;pimples&quot;) lack the opening to the skin. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Lesion Count at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Percent change in total lesion counts: inflammatory (papules, pustules and nodules) and non-inflammatory (comedones) lesion counts from baseline. Papules and nodules are round, solid elevations of the skin with no visible fluid; papules are smaller (less than 5 or 10 millimeters ) and nodules are larger (greater than 5 or 10 millimeters). Pustules are small elevations of the skin containing cloudy material. Comedones are small bumps on the skin caused by acne and found at the opening of a skin pore. A negative change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Demonstrating a ≥ 1 Category Increase in Tolerability From Baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The investigator rated the patient's current symptoms of erythema, dryness, peeling, and oiliness on a 5 point scale from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Severe). The investigator rated the symptoms of pruritus and burning since last visit on a 6 point scale of 0 (Absent) to 5 (Severe)-interfering with daily activities. Percentage of participants demonstrating a ≥1 category increase (improvement) in tolerability from baseline is calculated.</description>
