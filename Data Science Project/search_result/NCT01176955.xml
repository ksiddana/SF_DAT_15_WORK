  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-blinded, prospective study of 20 subjects aged 13 through 18 with
      mild to moderate acne. Study subjects will be randomized to an internet survey group, in
      which an email link for a survey ascertaining the status of the subject's acne is sent
      weekly, or to a control group. All study subjects will use benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, and
      adherence and clinical improvement will be monitored over 12 weeks. The investigators
      hypothesis is that subjects in the internet survey group will have improved adherence to the
      study medication and clinical outcomes, because the weekly survey will remind subjects to
      use their medication.
