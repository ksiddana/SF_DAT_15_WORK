      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study comparing
      tazarotene foam with vehicle foam in subjects with acne vulgaris.  Approximately 742
      subjects will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of the 2 study product groups in a 1:1 ratio
      (tazarotene foam: vehicle foam).  Subjects will apply tazarotene foam or vehicle foam to the
      entire face once daily for 12 weeks; study visits will occur at baseline (week 0/day 1) and
      at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.
