  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Visonac Photodynamic Therapy
      (PDT) in patients with severe acne, score 4 on global IGA scale.  The null hypothesis is
      that Visonac PDT is equal to vehicle PDT against the alternative hypothesis that Visonac PDT
      is different compared to vehicle PDT at week 12.

    <description>One Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale was used including inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. The investigator qualitatively graded the overall acne severity on a scale from 0 to 4, with 4 being the most severe. Success was defined as an improvement of at least 2 grades from the baseline score.</description>
