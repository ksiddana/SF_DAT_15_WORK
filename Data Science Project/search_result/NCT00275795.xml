  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy reactions cause various health disorders in sensitive people. These reactions
      may be IgE-mediated,cell-mediated, energy disturbance-mediated, or a combination of the
      three. Certain laboratory diagnostic procedures have been able to identify most IgE-mediated
      or cell-mediated food reactions, but so far there is no test available in traditional
      medicine to test the energy-mediated allergies and sensitivities. NAET® procedures have been
      able to identify food substances triggering to energ disturbances in sensitive people
      causing related health disorders. NAET uses one of the testing procedures called NST
      (Neuromuscular sensitivity testing).The efficacy of NST-NAET to screen food sensitivity will
      be evaluated in comparison with one of the well accepted, established, traditional medicine
      allergy testing  known as the IgE-specific antigen test.

      Forty-two volunteers responded for an advertisement posted on the NAET web site and in the
      community college news bulletin board inviting them to take part in the study. They were
      asked to complete the NAET® Allergy Symptom-Rating (ASR) questionnaire upon arrival at the
      research center. Observing inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 32 subjects from
      both sexes with varied health problems were selected  out of the forty-two who volunteered
      for the study. All 32 subjects were tested for 21 commonly used food substances via NST.
      Out of 32 tested, 26 subjects tested positive for one item each, from the 21 items tested
      and six subjects tested positive for multiple items from the selected food list.  The  32
      subjects  had a total of 50 positive NSTs out of 672 (21X32) tests performed. The items that
      produced positive results by NST  were further evaluated via laboratory blood serum analysis
      for IgE-specific antigens.  According to NST  the percentage of observed total food
      reactions in this group of 32 was 7.44%.  Soon after the completion of NST  the laboratory
      technicians collected blood from 32 subjects for IgE-specific antigen study on 50 positively
      tested items.  The IgE-specific antigen tests were found positive on a total of 49 out of 50
      tests performed.
