  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin and tazarotene are known to be effective treatment alternative
      for acne vulgaris. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a
      combination product including these actives for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

      You may be suitable to take part in this study because you have acne vulgaris on your face.
      Acne vulgaris usually affects the face, but it can also affect the skin on the chest, arms,
      legs, and back.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study subjects must have acne vulgaris and will apply study drug to their face for 12
      weeks.

      Study visits will occur at baseline (day 1) and at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  Subjects will be
      assessed at every visit to determine how the study drug is working. Safety will be assessed
      by evaluation of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and withdrawals
      from the study.
