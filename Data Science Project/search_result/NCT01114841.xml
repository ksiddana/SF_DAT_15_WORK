      This study will assess the potential of tazarotene foam to cause sensitization during a 48
      hour challenge following 21 days of exposure on the skin of healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam 0.1% to induce contact sensitization following
      repeated exposure under maximal stress conditions in healthy adult volunteers.
      Approximately 240 healthy, male and female, volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65 years will be
      enrolled.

      All subjects will be exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam and vehicle foam.
      Inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema, edema, papules) or superficial effects at patch
      sites will be visually assessed and scored according to the corresponding grading scales.

      The study duration will be 6 weeks or 9 weeks and will consist of the following phases: 3
      week Induction, 2 week Rest, and 1 week Challenge, and if indicated, a second 2 week Rest
      and 1 week Repeat Challenge.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
             authorization before any protocol-specific procedures are performed.

          -  Male or female aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.

          -  Able and willing to complete the study and to comply with all study instructions.

          -  Possess Fitzpatrick skin types I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns
             easily; tans minimally), III (burns moderately; tans gradually), or IV (rarely burns;
             tans with ease) that will not interfere with the evaluation of any skin responses
             (Fitzpatrick 1988).  Determination of skin types will be based on sunburn and tanning
             histories, as well as subjects' opinions of their responses to the first 30 to 45
             minutes of sun exposure.

          -  Male subjects and their partners must agree to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception.

        Additional criteria for women of childbearing potential, defined as one who is
        biologically capable of becoming pregnant, including perimenopausal women who are less
        than 2 years from their last menses:

          -  A regular menstrual cycle before study entry (as reported by the subject).

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks of the first application of study
             product.

          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the duration
             of the study.  Acceptable contraceptive methods include the following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening.  If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception has been completed.

               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier
                  methods.  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms.  A cervical
                  cap is also a reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has
                  never given birth vaginally.  The combined use of a condom and spermicide
                  constitute 2 forms of acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they
                  are both used properly.  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of
                  condoms are inferior methods of contraception.  Subjects with surgical
                  sterilization, including tubal sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a
                  form of nonhormonal contraception.  A barrier method or sterilization plus
                  spermicide is acceptable.

        Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically acceptable
        method of contraception should they become sexually active while participating in the
        study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             back due to sunburns, unevenness in skin tones, tattoos, scars, excessive hair,
             freckles, birthmarks, moles, or other skin damage or abnormality.

          -  Clinically significant skin diseases that may contraindicate participation or
             interfere with patch test site evaluations, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic
             dermatitis, acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin

          -  Currently using any medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect

          -  Participated in a previous study of the same study product.

          -  Employee of the study center, contract research organization, or Stiefel who is
             involved in the study, or an immediate family member (eg, partner, offspring,
             parents, siblings or sibling's offspring) of an employee who is involved in the
             study.
