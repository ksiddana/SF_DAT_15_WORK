  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, single-blind, randomized, comparative, split-face study. The duration of the
      study is 8 weeks.  Commencing at baseline, subjects will apply once daily both clindamycin
      and benzoyl peroxide gel and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene gel in a bilateral split-face
      fashion (allocation to left and right side randomly assigned) for an initial 2 weeks.  After
      visit 3, subjects will commence application of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide gel to the
      entire face for an additional 6 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, single-blind, randomized, comparative, split-face study. The duration of the
      study is 8 weeks and consists of a baseline visit and visits at weeks 1, 2, 5 and 8.
      Commencing at baseline, subjects will apply once daily both clindamycin and  benzoyl
      peroxide gel  and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene gel in a bilateral split-face fashion
      (allocation to left and right side randomly assigned) for an initial 2 weeks.  After visit 3
      subjects will commence application of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide gel to the entire
      face for an additional 6 weeks.

      Blinding This is an investigator-blinded study; therefore, subjects and study-center staff
      will not be blinded to study treatment allocation (ie, left vs. right side application).
      During the first 2 weeks, the investigator will be unaware of which study product is being
      used on either side of the face. Subjects and study-center staff will be instructed not to
      reveal study treatment allocation to the investigator.  Subjects will be instructed not to
      use study product in the presence of the investigator.

          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while receiving
             protocol-assigned product.

          -  Subjects willing to follow therapeutic instructions including avoidance of any other
             topical facial or systemic acne therapy during the conduct of the study.

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent before any protocol specific procedures are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Subjects who have any clinically relevant finding at their baseline physical
             examination or medical history such as severe systemic diseases, diseases of the
             facial skin, other than acne vulgaris.

          -  Facial hair that may obscure the accurate assessment of acne grade.

          -  History or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (e.g.,
             ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, or a history of
             antibiotic-associated colitis) or similar symptoms.

          -  Use of topical antibiotics on the face and systemic antibiotics within the past 2 and
             4 weeks, respectively.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids on the face or systemic corticosteroids within the
             past 4 weeks. Use of inhaled, intra-articular or intra-lesional (other than for
             facial acne lesions) steroids is acceptable.

          -  Use of systemic retinoids within the past 6 months.

          -  Concurrent use of drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines,
             fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of
             increased phototoxicity.

          -  Concomitant use of neuromuscular blocking agents.  Clindamycin has neuromuscular
             blocking activities, which may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking
             agents.

          -  Use of topical anti-acne medications within the past 2 weeks.

          -  Use of any investigational drugs or treatments during the study or within 4 weeks of
             the baseline visit.
