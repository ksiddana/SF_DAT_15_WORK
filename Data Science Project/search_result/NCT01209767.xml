  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intended to investigate and compare the changes that may occur in response to
      cryolipolysis (localized cool exposure) and subcision (surgical technique) on cellulite. The
      cryolipolysis cooling device used is FDA approved for skin cooling, but still
      investigational in the treatment of cellulite. It has previously been used for fat reduction
      on love handles or back fat. During cryolipolysis, the system drew fat tissue into an
      applicator then exposes the extracted fat tissue to cold temperatures. The cold exposure
      caused fat cells to die, with the goal to decrease the raised areas of cellulite. Subcision
      is a process used to treat scars left behind by acne or other skin diseases and has been
      noted to improve moderate to severe cellulite. Subcision is a simple surgical procedure that
      is performed by inserting a specially designed needle under the skin after local numbing
      medication is injected. The needle is moved in a repetitive motion parallel to the skin to
      separate the surface tissue from the deeper scar tissue with the goal to improve the
      dimpling caused by these tissues sticking together.  This study was a pilot study designed
      to determine feasibility of these procedures.

    <description>Two dermatologists blindly evaluated and compared the treated and control areas of each side at the final follow up visit (week 12). They rated the area with the best cosmetic appearance and reported the percentages of participants for whom &quot;Cryolipolysis&quot; or &quot;Subcision&quot; resulted in the &quot;best cosmetic appearance&quot;. It was possible for raters to determine that neither treatment outperformed the other, thereby rating the control arm better.</description>
