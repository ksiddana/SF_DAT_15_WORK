    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, single-blinded (investigator's blinded),
      active-controlled (clindamycin [CLDM] 1% gel), parallel-group study in Japanese subjects
      with acne vulgaris to demonstrate the efficacy of GSK2585823 (CLDM 1%-benzoyl peroxide [BPO]
      3% gel) when applied once or twice daily for 12 weeks.  This study will also evaluate the
      safety of GSK2585823 when applied topically either once or twice daily for 12 weeks.

      Main inclusion criteria will be 12 to 45 years of age, who have an Investigator Static
      Global Assessment (ISGA) score of 2 or greater at baseline visit, and have both 17 to 60
      facial inflammatory lesions (papules plus pustules) and 20 to 150 facial non-inflammatory
      lesions (open and closed comedones), including nasal lesions.  The primary objectives are to
      demonstrate the superiority of GSK2585823 twice daily to CLDM twice daily in total lesion
      counts, and to demonstrate the non-inferiority of GSK2585823 once daily to CLDM twice daily
      in total lesion counts.  The secondary objectives are to demonstrate the non-inferiority of
      GSK2585823 once daily to CLDM twice daily in inflammatory lesion counts, and to evaluate the
      efficacy of GSK2585823 once or twice daily compared with CLDM twice daily at each visit. A
      total of 800 subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the groups.
