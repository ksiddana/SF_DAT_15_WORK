      The purpose of this study is to compare adherence to treatment and efficacy with Epiduo速 Gel
      in patients with mild to moderate acne who receive a medication sample and instructions on
      proper application with their stock size medication tube versus patients who receive only
      the stock size medication tube.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject with mild to moderate acne, aged 12 and older, who agrees to
             participate and provides written consent.

          -  Have an Acne Global Assessment (AGA) of mild to moderate acne (an AGA score of 2 or
             3)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a concurrent medical condition or skin condition, which is determined by
             the investigator to potentially interfere with study outcomes or patient assessments.

          -  Subjects with known allergy or sensitivity to Epiduo速 Gel (or Benzoyl Peroxide Gel)
             or components therein, including adapalene or benzoyl peroxide

          -  Female subjects who are not postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile,
             or willing to practice effective contraception during the study.  Reliable methods of
             birth control are: abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             device (IUD), Depo-Provera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with
             confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An
             acceptable, although less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and
             spermicidal foam or gel and/or a cervical cap or sponge. Nursing mothers, pregnant
             women and women planning to become pregnant while on study are to be excluded.
