      This multicenter study will be divided into 2 phases. The first phase will be an open label,
      dose-escalation phase, while the second will be a blinded, randomized, vehicle-controlled,
      parallel-group, dose-response phase. The second phase will only start if the first phase
      succeeds in establishing well tolerated dose(s). Patients with moderate to severe acne
      vulgaris in the face will be included.The results from part 2 has been presented in the
      result section.

      For the second part: All patients will receive 4 PDT sessions 2 weeks apart using a light
      dose of 37 J/cm2. One treatment group will receive vehicle cream, while the other 2 groups
      will receive MAL cream with a concentration of 40 mg/g and 80 mg/g, respectively. The MAL
      and vehicle cream will be applied in a thin layer on clean skin and left for 1.5 hours under
      occlusion before illumination.

             days.

          3. Patients who have a condition or who are in a situation, which, in the investigator's
             opinion, may put the patient at risk, may confound the study results, or may
             interfere with the patient's participation in the study.

          4. Clinically significant sensitivity to visible light, or has porphyria or porphyrin
             sensitivity.

          5. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVB phototherapy, sun tanning salons) within the
