  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 week Phase 1 study of SB204 (NVN1000 Gel) in healthy adult volunteers with
      elevated Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) counts.  Subjects will apply NVN1000 4% Gel or
      Vehicle Gel twice daily to their face.  Assessments will include cutaneous tolerability,
      safety, and P. acnes counts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center, vehicle gel-controlled, evaluator and subject blinded study,
      approximately 30 otherwise healthy adult subjects with elevated P. acnes counts will be
      randomized 2:1 to NVN1000 4% Gel or Vehicle Gel.  The subjects will apply the test material
      twice daily to their face after washing.  Subjects will be seen daily at the skin study
      center during the week and will apply their evening and weekend dose at home.  Cutaneous
      tolerability will be assessed by the Investigator at Baseline, Week 1, and Week 2.  Safety
      assessments include collection of adverse events, laboratory results, and clinically
      significant changes in physical examination.  P. acnes counts will be obtained at Baseline,
      Week 1 and Week 2.
