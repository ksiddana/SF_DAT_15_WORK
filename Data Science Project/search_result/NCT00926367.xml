    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind (blinded expert grader), randomized, half-face study being conducted
      at one clinical site. On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of the 2 test
      products, antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide or benzoyl peroxide and adapalene gel and the
      contra lateral side of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control. Approximately
      25-30 male and female healthy subjects will be randomly assigned to each product

      This is a single-blind (blinded expert grader), parallel group, randomized, half-face study
      being conducted at one clinical site. On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of the
      2 test products, a topical antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide or benzoyl peroxide and adapalene
      and the contra lateral side of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control.
      Approximately 25-30 male and female healthy subjects will be randomly assigned to each
      product.

      The subjects will be entered into a 2-week treatment phase. The once-daily applications for
      the study medication will be supervised at the site, Monday through Friday of each week.
      Subjects will apply the study product at home on Saturdays and Sundays.

      A blinded expert grader will rate comparative product tolerance on each week day (excluding
      Saturdays and Sundays) during the study before study product is applied.

      Subject questionnaires will be completed along with collection of all adverse events.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 through Day 14</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Assessment of erythema as part of an evaluation of tolerance of two treatments: clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide or dapsone gel.  This was done by visual assessment by an independent blinded grader using the grading scale shown below.
Grade Description 0 None 2 Mild erythema 4 Moderate confluent erythema 6 Marked erythema with some edema 8 Marked erythema, edema, possible erosion</description>

    <measure>Skin Moisture and Hydration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 3, 7, and 14</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess skin moisture and hydration using transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Results are measured on a continuous scale.  Higher values indicate greater water loss/ lower skin moisture levels.
Evaporative water loss measurements provide an instrumental assessment of skin barrier function(one of the layers of the skin.    Damage leads to a disruption of the barrier that is accompanied by elevated water loss rates and affects skin moisture and hydration.  Higher values indicate greater water loss.</description>

    <measure>Skin Hydration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 hrs. post 1st Treatment, Days 3, 7, and 14</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The ability of an alternating current to flow through the stratum corneum is an indirect measure of its water content.  The value recorded is expressed in microsiemens. Higher values indicate greater levels of skin hydration.
Test results were compared to measurements from the other side of the face, which was not treated instead of referring to a normal range.  A normal range does not exist for this measurement.  Instead, the non-treated side of the face was used as a control to determine the normal level of skin hydration.</description>
