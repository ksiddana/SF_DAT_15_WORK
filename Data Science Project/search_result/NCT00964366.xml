  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, half-face study. On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of
      the 2 test products, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide or dapsone gel and the contra lateral
      side of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind (blinded expert grader), parallel group, randomized, half-face study
      being conducted at one clinical site. On 1 side of the face, the subject will apply 1 of the
      2 test products, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide or dapsone gel and the contra lateral side
      of the face will remain non-treated to serve as a control. Approximately 25-30 male and
      female healthy subjects without facial acne, aged 18 to 45, will be randomly assigned to
      each product.

      The eligible subjects who qualify will be entered into a 2-week treatment phase. The first
      of application of the study medication will be supervised at the site, Monday through Friday
      of each week.  Any additional applications should be applied by the subjects at home each
      evening and the times of application recorded on a diary card. Subjects will apply the study
      product at home on Saturdays and Sundays and record the times of application on a diary
      card.

      A blinded expert grader will rate comparative product tolerance during the study before
      study product is applied.

      Instrumentation measurements of TEWL will be utilized to evaluate product mildness.

      Duplicate sebum samples will be taken from the left and right forehead areas and assessed.

      Subject will complete questionnaires and all adverse events will be recorded.

    <description>The amount of dryness on the left and right cheek of each panelist.
The scale used to evaluate skin dryness is:
Grade Description 0 None 2 Slight flaking 4 Moderate flaking/scaling 6 Marked scaling / slight fissuring 8 Severe scaling, fissuring
Expert Grader assessments of dryness were taken prior to product application on Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 and 14.</description>

    <measure>Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess skin moisture and hydration using transepidermal water loss (TEWL). These tables record the data obtained for each panelist at Baseline, and on Days 3, 7 and 14 or upon early termination of site(s), if applicable. Results are measured on a continuous scale.</description>

    <measure>Sebum Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To sample the skin surface, the sebum collector strips are applied to the skin sites for 10 seconds. Once removed, these samples will be immediately measured for the amount of sebum on the strip using the tape analyzer. The amount of sebum production was measured as the amount of sebum collected on a tape applied to the skin for 10 seconds and then converted to 1 of 10 incremental levels. Sebum production was measured in increments of 0 (minimum value) to 10 (maximum value). The higher the number, the greater amount of sebum produced.</description>
