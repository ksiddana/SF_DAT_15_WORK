  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand how this study pillowcase works
      when people use it to treat acne.  Most people, including people with acne, sleep six to
      eight hours each night in direct contact with bedding fabrics that provide no benefit to the
      healing process associated with acne.  The fabric in this study pillowcase may be able to
      reduce bacteria on the skin.  This study would evaluate how acne is affected by this
      silk-like pillowcase. This type of study has not been done before.

    <description>The study pillowcases are fabricated from a light-weight plain-weave fabric woven of 100 percent synthetic yarns.  The fabric is comprised of approximately 50% polyester and 50% nylon.  The yarns in the fabric are formed from continuous-filament fibers, with no fibers projecting beyond the planar surface of the fabric.  The antimicrobial technology used in the fabric is incorporated into the fibers during the finishing process and does not migrate out of the fabric or cause adverse reactions with skin contact.</description>
