    <description>Quantitative bacterial examinations were performed on the subjects' face during the study. These samplings were performed using a method to quantify the follicular microbiological flora of the skin (at Baseline and Week 12 visits).This method consists of a technique allowing the extraction of the outermost layer of epidermis from hair follicle on the cheek and to culture the samplings in order to have the number of P. acnes.
Outcome measure = Change from baseline (Log10 cfu/cm²) in count of Follicular P. acnes at end of the study.</description>
