  <brief_title>A Study That Evaluates the Decrease in Irritation When Using Additional Acne Treatment Products</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Investigator-Blind, Phase 4 Study Assessing Mitigation of Facial Irritation When Comparing the Use of Two Acne Treatment Products (Retin-A Micro® 0.1 % Pump and Aczone®) With One Treatment Product (Retin-A Micro® 0.1 % Pump) Using a Split-Face Model</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to see if there's any difference in the amount of facial irritation when two
      acne products are used together on one side of the face, compared to one acne treatment
      product used alone on the other side of the face.  All people participating in this trial
      will be required to return to the same study center every weekday for two weeks for the
      investigator to check for irritation on the face and to have the products applied - on
      weekends they will have to put them on at home.  If one side of the face is more irritated
      than the other side, a picture will be taken as well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-blind, randomized, balanced study comparing two treatment regimens
      in a split-face model.  All subjects will apply Retin-A Micro Gel (tretinoin) 0.1 % Pump,
      and Aczone Gel (dapsone) 5% daily to one side of the face (with 1 hour between applications,
      applying Aczone Gel first) and Retin-A Micro Gel 0.1 %  Pump to the other side of the face
      in a randomized scheme for two consecutive weeks. Subjects will return to the study center
      daily for evaluation and for application of both products (weekend applications will be done
      at home). At each visit the subject will be evaluated and scored for irritation and
      cutaneous treatment effects.  Subjects presenting with differences in irritation between one
      side of the face and the other will be photographed and have chromometer readings taken.  A
      single treatment center is expected to enroll at least 24 subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Expert Grader Assessment - Erythema</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Ordinal erythema scores (on a scale of 0=none to 8=severe scaling and fissuring) were collected on weekdays for two weeks and the total daily score (for all subjects) was treated as a single interval measurement for comparative assessment between treatment regimens.  Thus, for the total for the 25 Participants measured, minimum possible score reported below is 0 and maximum is 2000 (highest possible score of 8, times 10 days, times 25 subjects).</description>

    <description>Ordinal dryness scores (on a scale of 0=none to 8=deep) were collected on weekdays for two weeks and the total daily score (for all subjects) was treated as a single interval measurement for comparative assessment between treatment regimens.  Thus, for the total for the 25 Participants measured, minimum possible score reported below is 0 and maximum is 2000 (highest possible score of 8, times 10 days, times 25 subjects).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Ordinal burning/stinging scores (on a scale of 0=none to 3=severe) were collected on weekdays for two weeks and the total daily score (for all subjects) was treated as a single interval measurement for comparative assessment between treatment regimens.  Thus, for the total for the 25 Participants measured, minimum possible score reported below is 0 and maximum is 750 (highest possible score of 3, times 10 days, times 25 subjects).</description>

    <measure>Subject Assessment - Itching</measure>

    <description>Ordinal itching scores (on a scale of 0=none to 3=severe) were collected on weekdays for two weeks and the total daily score (for all subjects) was treated as a single interval measurement for comparative assessment between treatment regimens.  Thus, for the total for the 25 Participants measured, minimum possible score reported below is 0 and maximum is 750 (highest possible score of 3, times 10 days, times 25 subjects).</description>

    <measure>Subject Assessment - Tightness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Ordinal tightness scores (on a scale of 0=none to 3=severe) were collected on weekdays for two weeks and the total daily score (for all subjects) was treated as a single interval measurement for comparative assessment between treatment regimens.  Thus, for the total for the 25 Participants measured, minimum possible score reported below is 0 and maximum is 750 (highest possible score of 3, times 10 days, times 25 subjects).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>All interval measurements were combined for comparative assessment between treatment regimens.  Facial tolerance is the sum of scores from Erythema, Dryness, Burning/Stinging, Itching, and Tightness assessments, reported in Outcome Measures 1-5.  Thus, for the total for the 25 Participants measured, minimum possible score reported below is 0 and maximum is 6250 (highest possible combined score of 25, times 10 days, times 25 subjects).</description>
