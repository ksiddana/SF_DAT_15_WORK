  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne is an inflammation of sebaceous glands and follicles. Applying topical treatments such
      as adapalene gel may cause irritant adverse effects. Hence, using a moisturizer is another
      way to protect or relieve this undesirable event. Moisturizers that have anti-inflammatory
      property could reduce irritant effects, emergent from using topical treatment and also
      reduce severity of acne.

      Research teams chose an adapalene gel to act as topical treatment for curing acne. It has
      anti-inflammatory and comedolytic effects and has fewer side effects than other groups of
      topical retinoic acids. However, peeling skin, redness skin, tingling sensation or itching
      sensation may occur if they are continually used for a long period. Thus, for the purpose of
      studying the efficacy of moisturizer containing licochalcone A, L-carnitine and
      1,2-decanediol in reducing irritant effect of using adapalene gel (Licochalcone A has
      anti-inflammatory effect, L-carnitine decrease sebum production and 1,2-decanediol has
      anti-bacterial effect).

      The investigators team research with patients by separate patients into 3 groups and compare
      among each other. In the first group use only adapalene gel, the second group use adapalene
      gel with moisturizer containing three substances mentioned above, and the last group use
      adapalene gel with placebo moisturizer. To compare outcomes among 3 groups, the
      investigators will measure degree of redness, scale, oily face, moist, number of acne,
      quality of life, and satisfaction after using moisturizer.
