  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to determine if using 2 acne products in the morning is as safe and efficacious as
      using one product in the morning and one product in the evening.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 240 subjects will be enrolled in this randomized, multi-center study.
      Following satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures, all subjects will receive
      RETIN-A MICRO PUMP 0.04% and a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide wash (OTC) for the entire 12-week
      treatment period.  Subjects will be randomized to either both morning treatments (test) or
      to the morning/evening treatment (active control).  Subjects will be assessed at baseline,
      at week 3, week 6 and again at the end of therapy, week 12 for number and type of individual
      lesions and safety.  At selected sites, photographs will be taken at the same time points.
      At Week 12 subjects will be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment of Acne Severity.
      The investigator will conduct all of the lesion counts, global assessments and safety
      assessments.
