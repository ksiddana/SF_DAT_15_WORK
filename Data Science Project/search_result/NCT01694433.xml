  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of topical Vitamin D cream (Calcipotriene,
      also known as Dovonex)  on the face and on the bacteria that cause acne. The information
      gained from this study may lead to new treatments for acne. In this study, Calcipotriene
      will be compared with a placebo, a cream that looks like Calcipotriene, but contains no
      active ingredients.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blinded, parallel group comparison of calcipotriene
      vs. placebo cream. Patients with acne will use calcipotriene or placebo cream 2x/day for 12
      weeks and will be assessed at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12.  Each group will have 24 subjects as
      calculated by power analysis.  Three additional subjects for each group will be recruited
      for possible dropouts and total of 27 subjects will be recruited for each group. Primary
      endpoint (lesion count) and secondary endpoints described in aims 3.2-3.4 will be
      determined. Lesion counts will be assessed by one of the investigator physicians or nurse
      practitioner. Adverse effects including irritation, dry skin, inflammation and worsening of
      the lesions will be noted at each visit. Photographs will be taken to aid in assessing the
      clinical changes.
