  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the risks of short- and long-term use of NOMAC-E2 (containing a fixed
      dose of nomegestrol acetate and estradiol) compared with levonorgestrel-containing combined
      oral contraceptives (COC-LNG) in a study population representative of the actual users of
      the individual preparations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NOMAC-E2 is a novel monophasic oral contraceptive containing a fixed dose of nomegestrol
      acetate (2.5mg) and 17ß-estradiol (1.5mg) which is taken for 24 days followed by 4 days of
      placebo.  The most relevant adverse clinical outcome that has been linked to the use of COCs
      is venous thromboembolism (VTE).  Data from randomized clinical trials did not show any
      serious health concerns for NOMAC-E2.  However, the statistical power to detect rare adverse
      events is limited in these studies.

      PRO-E2 is a large, prospective, controlled, long-term active surveillance study to
      investigate the safety of NOMAC-E2 with regard to the outcomes of interest.  This study
      follows the European Active Surveillance (EURAS) design methodology with some modifications
      due to country- and product-specific characteristics.  The outcomes of interest will be
      validated via the attending physicians.  A multi-faceted follow-up procedure will ensure a
      low loss to follow-up rate.  This study will involve women from Europe and Australia who
      will be followed for up to 2 years. Data analysis will include multivariable techniques such
      as Cox regression.
