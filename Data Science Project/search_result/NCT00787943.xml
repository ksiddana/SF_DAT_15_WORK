      This study is a split face, paired-comparison, pilot study of 10 subjects. Participants in
      this study will be patients seen at Children's Memorial Hospital, who are clinically
      diagnosed with mild to moderate acne vulgaris.  Participants will be recruited from the
      clinic, as well as advertising and from previous Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved
      acne studies housed in the Department of Dermatology. All subjects accrued from previous
      studies have agreed to be contacted for further investigations.   Subjects 13 to 35 years of
      age with mild to moderate acne vulgaris symmetrical in appearance on both sides of the face,
      and meeting inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate.

      Acne vulgaris is a follicular disorder occurring in pilosebaceous units in the skin of the
      face, neck, and upper trunk. These sebaceous follicles have follicular channels and adjacent
      multiacinar sebaceous glands. In the lubrication process of normal skin, sebum travels
      through the follicular canal to the skin surface, carrying along with it desquamated cells
      from follicular epithelium. Acne develops when these specialized follicles undergo
      pathologic alterations that result in the formation of non-inflammatory lesions (comedones)
      and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules).

      The basic cause of acne remains unknown, but its manifestations are thought to be the
      product of four pathogenic events: 1) increased sebum production fueled by androgenic
      stimulation in the pubertal period; 2) obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit due to an
      abnormal keratinization process; 3) proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, an anaerobic
      diptheroid normally residing in pilosebaceous follicles; and 4) inflammation that is
      mediated both by the action of chemotactic factors and various enzymes, and initiated in
      part by the interaction of P. acnes with toll-like receptors. Impaction of the pilosebaceous
      follicle gives rise to the microcomedo that is thought to be the precursor lesion of acne.

      Topical benzoyl peroxide is a common and well-established agent with known antibacterial and
      antimicrobial properties used in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  The safety profile for
      topical benzoyl peroxide has been well delineated. The most common side effects attributed
      to benzoyl peroxide products include irritation, dryness, scaling, burning and stinging.

      Benzoyl peroxide 10.0% creams (Formulation #1 and Formulation #2) will be evaluated to
      detect any differences in their response for safety and efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects who are 13 to 35 years of age.

          2. Subjects are in good health and are free of any other facial skin disorders that may
             interfere with acne study assessments.

          3. Subjects have the willingness and ability to understand and provide informed
             assent/consent to participate in the study and are able to communicate with the
             investigator. Subjects are willing and able to follow all study directions and to

          9. Subjects who have used tanning devices within one week prior to baseline study visit.

         10. Subjects who have applied any topical products (e.g. emollients, sunscreens) or any
             cosmetics to the face at least one hour prior to study assessments.

         11. Use of hormonal oral contraceptives for acne control or for less than 6 months prior
             to study baseline.

         12. Subjects with known allergies, a history of allergy or sensitivity to benzoyl
             peroxide, or any of the test article components.

         13. Subjects using topical or systemic medication within 14 days before the study entry,
