      RATIONALE: Regenecare® wound gel may help relieve pain and itching in patients who develop
      an acne-like rash while undergoing treatment with cetuximab or another epidermal growth
      factor receptor inhibitor for cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well Regenecare® wound gel works in treating
      rash in patients receiving cetuximab or another epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor
      therapy for cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of Regenecare® wound gel in alleviating pain and itching in
           patients who develop an acneiform rash while undergoing treatment with cetuximab or
           other EGFR inhibitor therapy for cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in reducing the severity of rash in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in reducing the redness and appearance of the rash
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

        -  Observation: Patients undergo evaluation by full-face photography prior to development
           of skin rash (baseline). While undergoing concurrent cancer therapy, patients
           self-monitor for the appearance of an acneiform rash. Upon initial onset of rash,
           patients proceed to treatment.

        -  Treatment: Patients apply topical Regenecare® wound gel to the face ≥ 4 times daily.
           Treatment continues for 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are evaluated weekly by facial examination, full-face photography, and patient
      satisfaction questionnaires.
