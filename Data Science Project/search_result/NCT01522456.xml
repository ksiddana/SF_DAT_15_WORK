  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the tolerability of Epiduo速 (adapalene and benzoyl peroxide) Gel 0.1%/2.5% to
      Retin-A Micro速 (tretinoin gel) microsphere, 0.1% in subjects with acne vulgaris treated once
      daily for three (3) weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult subjects with acne vulgaris will receive tretinoin gel 0.1% on one side of the face
      and adapalene 0.1% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel on the other side of the face once daily for
      a period of 22 days.  Tolerability assessments on both sides of the face will be taken on
      each visit, which will be each weekday from baseline through day 22.
