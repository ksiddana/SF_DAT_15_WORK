      This study will identify how much (if any) drug is absorbed from the skin of subjects with
      acne vulgaris after topical application of SB204.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, 2 period cross-over study to be conducted
      in 18 subjects (18 years of age and above) each of whom will receive SB204 8% and Vehicle
      Gel. Subjects who satisfy the entry criteria will be randomized to SB204 8% or Vehicle Gel
      in a 1:1 ratio for the first treatment period.  Study drug will be applied to the face,
      upper chest, upper back and shoulders (approximately 17% BSA) twice daily on Days 1- 4
      approximately 12 hours apart.  On Day 5, the study drug will be applied to the same areas
      only once, in the morning.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling will be performed on Day 1 and
      Day 5.  After a wash out period, subjects will be treated with the alternate product and
      undergo similar treatment and assessments. The primary assessment is the pharmacokinetic
      profile of nitrate and silicon as markers for systemic exposure to nitric oxide (nitrate)
      and NVN1000 (silicon) after topical application of SB204 8% to approximately 17% of the
      total body surface area.

    <description>During the study, cutaneous tolerability assessments will be made at Day 1 and at the end of each treatment period (Day 5). Erythema, dryness, scaling, stinging/burning and itching will be assessed on a four point scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.</description>
