      This  is a two-center, open-label pilot study.  The study is apprised of 7 study visits:
      Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24.  All subjects will receive Aczone 5% gel BID and
      doxycycline 100mg by mouth once daily at Baseline.  Those subjects achieving treatment
      response (i.e., IGA of 0, 1 or 2) at Week 12 will continue treatment with Aczone 5% gel BID
      at Week 12.  Subjects not achieving treatment response will discontinue study participation.
