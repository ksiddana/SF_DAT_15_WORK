  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study in patients with moderate to severe
      chronic hidradenitis suppurativa in parallel groups, to determine the efficacy and safety of
      multiple doses of CJM112 in comparison to placebo. The study has two periods to explore
      preliminary dose effects.
