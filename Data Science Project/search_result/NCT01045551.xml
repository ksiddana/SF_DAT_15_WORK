  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder with the signs and symptoms of facial flushing,
      persistent redness, small visible spider-like veins, papules (inflamed red bumps under the
      skin) and pustules.  Rosacea is also a a recurring skin disorder.  In addition to causing
      uncomfortable and embarrassing physical symptoms such as flushing, burning, and itching,
      rosacea can also contribute to lower self-esteem, which can have a significant psychosocial
      impact on quality of life.  Rosacea flares can be triggered by every day factors such as sun
      exposure, heat, hot or caffeinated drinks, alcoholic beverages, spices and stress.

      Many of the currently available treatments for rosacea are only partially effective and some
      patients do not respond to them, or are unable to tolerate the side effects.

      This is a single-center, open label trial of Apremilast in ten (10) subjects with moderate
      to severe inflammatory rosacea who will be treated with Apremilast 20 mg twice per day for
      12 weeks.  Following the screening period and baseline visit, study subjects will return at
      weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.  There is a follow up study visit at week 16.

      Recent research has shown an increase of specific proinflammatory cytokines in the biopsies
      of inflammatory lesions from rosacea and acne patients.  The cytokines then trigger a chain
      of chemical responses in the body that likely result in the development of the papules an
      pustules that are seen in rosacea and acne patients.  Apremilast is an oral agent that
      modulates multiple anti-inflammatory pathways and has pharmacodynamic properties with
      potential therapeutic benefit for treating inflammatory autoimmune disorders.

      The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to evaluate the potential for Apremilast
      to improve the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe inflammatory rosacea.

      This is a single-center, open label pilot study of Apremilast in ten subjects  with both
      erythematotelangiectatic rosacea and papulopustular rosacea in which subjects will be
      treated with Apremilast 20mg twice per day for 12 weeks. There is a total of 10 visits over
      a period of 16 weeks.

      Adult male and female subjects 18 years of age or older will participate in the study after
      the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of the study have been fully explained, and
      after they have signed the informed consent form. Subjects must have a diagnosis or findings
      consistent with erythematotelangiectatic and papulopustular rosacea.  Subjects must have at
      least 10 papulopustular lesions with underlying erythema/telangiectasias visible to the
      unassisted naked eye.

      Subjects will take Apremilast capsules 20mg twice per day for 12 weeks.  If at anytime
      during the study a subject encounters overt study medication related adverse effects, dose
      reduction will be allowed following discussions between the subject and the investigator.
      Dose reductions to 20mg once per day will be allowed for subjects who experience intolerable
      adverse effects from the study medication.  If the subject cannot tolerate 20mg per day,
      he/she will be terminated from the study.
