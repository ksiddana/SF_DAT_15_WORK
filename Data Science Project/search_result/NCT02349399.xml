      The study objectives are to characterize new users of Cyproterone Acetate / Ethinylestradiol
      (CPA/EE) in 2011/2012 and in 2014 according to demographics, treatment characteristics,
      previous diagnosis of acne, hirsutism or other hyperandrogenic conditions, previous acne
      treatment and (concomitant) use of hormonal contraceptives identified in Healthcare
      Databases in the UK (THIN), the Netherlands (PHARMO) and Italy (HSD).

             with recorded history in the database of ≥ 365 days prior to index date will be
             included in the study.
