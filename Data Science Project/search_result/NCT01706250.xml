      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use.  Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability.  Whatever
      the reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on
      the part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of 2
      over-the-counter, topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) product lines in subjects with acne:
      MAXCLARITY II (2.5% BPO) Foam Cleanser and Foam Treatment and (0.5% Salicylic Acid) Toner
      Foam compared with PROACTIV (2.5% BPO) Renewing Cleanser and Repairing Lotion and
      Revitalizing Toner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is an extremely common dermatological disease that is found typically in
      adolescence and young adulthood.  Acne vulgaris manifests with open and closed comedones
      (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts on the face, neck, and
      trunk.  Scarring can occur, particularly if the lesions are inflamed and deep, even in the
      absence of external manipulation (eg, picking and squeezing) of the skin.

      Acne vulgaris can be treated with a variety of agents that are selected to address the
      pathogenic factors assumed to be responsible for the type and degree of manifested acne
      lesions.  Monotherapy and combination therapy regimens are both useful.  Topical agents are
      generally used as first-line therapy and include retinoids, antibiotic preparations (eg,
      erythromycin and clindamycin), benzoyl peroxide (BPO), alpha and beta hydroxy acids (eg,
      glycolic and salicylic acid preparations), and azelaic acid.  Systemic therapies are
      initiated in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne that does not respond to
      topical therapy.

      Benzoyl peroxide has antimicrobial and anti inflammatory properties and is often considered
      an important component of acne treatment.   Benzoyl peroxide is frequently the first product
      that adolescents will use for acne because it can be purchased without a prescription in
      several different concentrations and formulations.

      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use.  Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability.  Whatever
      the reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on
      the part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of 2 common,
      over-the-counter, topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) product lines in subjects with acne:
      MAXCLARITY II (2.5% BPO) Foam Cleanser and Foam Treatment and (0.5% Salicylic Acid) Toner
      Foam compared with PROACTIV(2.5% BPO) Renewing Cleanser and Repairing Lotion and
      Revitalizing Toner.

      This is a randomized, 2 center, evaluator-blinded, split-face efficacy and tolerability
      study of MAXCLARITYII and PROACTIV, 2 over-the-counter, topical benzoyl peroxide product
      lines, in subjects with acne.  Approximately 40 subjects, aged from 16 to 29 years,
      inclusive, with mild facial acne vulgaris are expected to participate in the study.  No more
      than 50% of the subjects at each site can be enrolled under the age of 20.

      An expert grader (blinded evaluator) will complete counts of inflamed lesions
      (papules/pustules) and noninflamed lesions (open/closed comedones), the Investigator's
      Static Global Assessment (ISGA), and an assessment of tolerability of each side of the face
      at each study visit.  Subjects will assess tolerability on each side of the face at each
      study visit and will complete a product acceptability and preference questionnaire at the
      end of the study.

      The study duration will be 8 weeks (56 days) with visits at baseline (day 1), week 1m week
      2, week 4 and week 8.  Only the expert grader (evaluator) will be blinded to the study
      product assignments; subjects and study nurses/coordinator will not be blinded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any
             protocol specific procedures are performed.

          2. Male or female aged from 16 to 29 years, inclusive, at time of consent. No more than
             50% of the subjects at each site can be enrolled under the age of 20.

          3. Mild facial acne vulgaris, characterized by at least 12 facial inflammatory lesions
             (papules and pustules) and/or noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on
             the face.

          4. Able to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.

          5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while receiving
             protocol-assigned product.  A woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who
             is biologically capable of becoming pregnant; including perimenopausal women who are
             less than 2 years from their last menses.  Acceptable contraceptive methods include
             the following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening.  If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception has been completed.

               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier
                  methods.  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms.  A cervical
                  cap is also a reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has
                  never given birth naturally.  The combined use of a condom and spermicide
                  constitute 2 forms of acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they
                  are both used properly.  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of
                  condoms are inferior methods of contraception.  Subjects with surgical
                  sterilization, including tubal sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a
                  form of nonhormonal contraception.  A barrier method or sterilization plus
                  spermatocide is acceptable.

               -  Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically
                  accepted method of contraception should she become sexually active while
                  participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.

          2. Has active or chronic skin allergies.

          3. Has a history of acute or chronic disease that might interfere with or increase the
             risk of study participation.

          4. Had skin cancer treatment in preceding 12 months.

          5. Has damaged skin on facial areas (eg, sunburn, tattoo, or scar)

          6. Had any medical procedure (eg, laser resurfacing, chemical peel, or plastic surgery)
             on facial areas in preceding 12 months.

          7. Had any cosmetic procedure (eg, microdermabrasion) on facial areas within 8 weeks of
             the baseline visit.

          8. Has any dermatological disorder that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere
             with the accurate evaluation of the subject's facial appearance.

          9. Received any investigational drug or procedure within 28 days of the baseline visit
             or is scheduled to receive an investigational drug (other than the study products) or
             procedure during the study.

         10. Currently using any medication that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the
             evaluation of the study products or place the subject at undue risk (including but
             not limited to asthma medications, oral steroids, rifampin, anticonvulsants, and St
             John's wart).

         11. Has a history of known or suspected intolerance to any of the ingredients of the
             study products (ie, benzoyl peroxide).
