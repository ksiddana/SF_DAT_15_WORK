          3. Subjects have the willingness and ability to understand and provide informed
             assent/consent to participate in the study and are able to communicate with the
             investigator. Subjects are willing and able to follow all study directions and to
             commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study. In addition, subjects

             relatively symmetrical in appearance on both sides of the face.

          5. Ongoing oral medications (other than those specifically for acne) are acceptable
             provided subjects are on a stable regimen throughout the study and provided the
             medications are determined likely to not interfere with study assessments.

          6. Subjects will not use medicated cosmetics and/or soaps (including soaps containing
             antibacterial agents such as benzoyl peroxide, keratolytic agents such as salicylic

          6. Subjects with excessive facial hair that may interfere with study assessments.

          7. Subjects with other facial skin disorders that may interfere with study assessments.

          8. Subjects with a history of skin cancer or actinic keratosis.

          9. Subjects who have used tanning devices within one week prior to baseline study visit.

             cosmetics to the face at least one hour prior to study assessments.

             antibacterial agents to the face, and any immunosuppressive drugs.  Ongoing oral
             medications not expected to interfere with study assessments are allowed if the
             subject is on a stable regimen.

         14. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another clinical investigation or have been
             enrolled in an acne trial within a period of 30 days prior to enrollment in this
             study.

         15. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing.
