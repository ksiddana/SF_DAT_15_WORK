  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin in the pilosebaceous unit of
      the hair follicle, associated with oil production. It is found across skin types and is
      present in 85% of adolescents, representing a large affected population. Because of the
      universal nature of the disease, 36.3% of acne patients come from backgrounds other than
      Caucasian.

      The purpose of this study is to examine patient knowledge about acne in different
      populations and to assess the effectiveness of a teaching intervention on acne knowledge.
      The investigators aim is to better understand and subsequently reduce any potential health
      disparities within the minority populations.

      This project will evaluate differences in acne knowledge between different ethnic groups,
      and the efficacy of an educational intervention. Subjects will first complete a survey
      evaluating their knowledge of acne and how acne affects them psychosocially before an
      educational intervention. Immediately following the intervention, the patient's knowledge of
      acne will be evaluated again. Finally, two months after the intervention, a phone call will
      be made evaluating their retention of the education materials and their quality of life
      related to psychosocial effects of acne. Investigating this educational intervention and any
      current disparities in acne education and understanding will better allow us to educate and
      treat acne patients in the future.
