  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Co-primary Outcome 1: Change From Baseline in Total Nodular Lesion Count (Facial and Truncal)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The change from Baseline to Week 20 in the total number of nodular lesions was calculated as the Week 20 lesion count minus Baseline lesion count and compared using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for Baseline total nodular lesion count, gender and analysis site.
The 95% CI of the adjusted least square mean difference (CIP-ISOTRETINOIN minus Isotretinoin) was also calculated using the ANCOVA model.
Pre-defined criterion for non-inferiority: upper bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference &lt; 4.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Co-Primary Outcome 2: Proportion of Patients Who Achieve at Least a 90% Reduction in Total Number of Nodular Lesions (Facial and Truncal).</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The percentage of patients in each group who achieved ≥90% reduction in the total nodular lesion count from Baseline to Week 20 was calculated along with its 95% CI (normal approximation). A 95% 2-sided CI on the difference between treatments (CIP-ISOTRETINOIN minus Isotretinoin) was also computed.
Pre-defined criterion for non-inferiority: lower bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference &gt; -10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients Who Are Rated as Clear/Almost Clear on the Six-point Physicians' Global Assessment Scale (PGSA).</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PGSA categories: 1 (Almost clear); 2 (Mild); 3 (Moderate); 4 (Severe); 5 (Very severe). A grade of either 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on the 6-point PGSA scale within the Week 20 analysis window was considered a success.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe recalcitrant nodular acne, which in the opinion of the investigator is
             compatible with isotretinoin treatment.

          -  Ten (10) or more nodular lesions (facial and/or truncal).

          -  Treatment-naïve patients without any prior exposure to systemic isotretinoin or other
             retinoids.

          -  Age between 12 and 54 years.

          -  Weight between 40 and 110 kg.

          -  Negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test consistent with a
             non-pregnant state (females only).

          -  No significant disease or clinically significant finding in a physical examination.

          -  No clinically significant abnormal laboratory value.

          -  No clinically significant abnormal vital sign measurement.

          -  Patients presenting with stable and controlled diabetes mellitus (Types I and II) may
             be included in the study. However, patients should not have had a hospitalization for
             any diabetes related complications in the last 12 months, and must be on stable
             medication for the preceding 6 months. To be included in the study, the patients
             should have Hemoglobin-A1c values ≤ 6.5% at screening and in the test done 3 - 4
             months previously.

          -  Patients with previously diagnosed Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) may be included
             in the study if in the opinion of the investigator they do not have any other
             clinically significant abnormality (e.g. metabolic syndrome or elevated lipids).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients will be excluded from the study if they:

               -  Are pregnant;

             evaluation of recalcitrant nodular acne.

             Depression, Mania, and Psychosis. Patients with a lifetime history of psychosis will
             be excluded. Patients with a history of major depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed

          -  A lifetime history of wishing to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts or
             active suicidal ideation without intent to act will not result in exclusion.
