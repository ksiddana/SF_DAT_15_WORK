    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to enroll 250 participants that have joined the MURDOCK Study
      Horizon 1.5 (Duke IRB Pro00011196) with a current or prior diagnosis of severe acne AND
      current or prior treatment with oral isotretinoin.  All 250 participants will answer a
      5-page questionnaire designed to collect information on the diagnosis of severe acne and
      response to oral isotretinoin treatment.  The aim is to identify genetic predictors of
      severe acne vulgaris and the outcome of oral isotretinoin treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is an under-studied common genetic disease with tremendous economic
      consequences. Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions treated by doctors.
      It affects 40-50 million people in the USA, with prevalence as high as 85% (recent study
      from Iran was 93%) in teenagers; 18% of woman have late onset (&gt;25yr) acne vulgaris.  Severe
      acne has a life-long psychosocial impact due to the significant scarring.   Severe acne can
      also be associated with severe systemic inflammatory disease with fever, sterile
      osteomyelitis, inflammatory arthritis and other signs of systemic inflammatory responses.
      Some of these syndromes in Mendelian form (e.g. PAPA syndrome) have known genetic defects.
      Finally, while the data are inconclusive, there have been many suggestions that diet can
      exacerbate acne in some patients.  The standard of care treatment for severe acne is
      systemic retinoid therapy, which, is usually, but not always effective.  Unfortunately,
      systemic retinoid treatment is associated with significant toxicity, including common
      cutaneous adverse effects (dry lips, eyes, skin fragility), less common laboratory
      abnormalities such as elevated blood lipids, liver function abnormalities, and severe
      predictable teratogenicity.  In addition, systemic therapy with retinoids has been
      associated with systemic diseases such as clinical depression, suicide, and inflammatory
      bowel disease, however the mechanisms and significance of these associations has not been
      determined.    Given the frequency and severity of severe acne,   the predictable severe
      toxicity of systemic retinoid therapy, and the already demonstrated genetic associations
      found in Mendelian forms of severe acne, it seems likely that significant genetic risk
      factors may be identified in patients with severe acne which would promote new and safer
      therapy, including dietary adjustment.

    <description>All 250 patients with severe acne will be genotyped using the Illumina 610 BeadChip.  Whole-exome sequencing will be performed on 100 extremely severe acne vulgaris patients, selected based on severity and response to oral isotretinoin treatment.  A case-control GWAS analysis will be performed (250 recruited patients vs. 1000 normal controls of convenience available in other studies at CHGV).  Additionally, an association analyses will be conducted using complete exome sequencing data for the most severe cases, compared with controls of convenience (as an extreme trait in the population, there is a reasonable expectation of discovery of any important variants, rare or common). This analysis would also include targeted analysis on available drug response data (efficacy and adverse response).</description>

        Participants must enroll or have enrolled in the MURDOCK Study Community Registry and
        Biorepository prior to joining this Severe Acne Study.  At the MURDOCK Study visit, or
        after the participant has enrolled in the MURDOCK Study, they will be asked (either in
        person or via phone) if they would be willing to join the Severe Acne Study.

        Participants between ages 12 and 18 may also join the MURDOCK Study if they meet the
        eligibility criteria for this Severe Acne Study (a pediatric consent form will be used).
