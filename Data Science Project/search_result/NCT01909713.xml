      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability of Cetaphil® DermaControl™ Foam
      Wash and Moisturizer SPF 30 in pediatric subjects (7-11) with acne prone skin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a open-label, single center study conducted in the United States that evaluated the
      tolerability of Cetaphil® DermaControl™ skin care products used at least once daily for 22
      days in male and female subjects age 7 to 11 with acne prone skin. There were 4 visits
      during the course of the study: screening (within 7 days of visit 1), visit 1(baseline
      /day1), visit 2 (day 8), and visit 3 (day 22/exit). Tolerability assessments were performed
      by a board certified dermatologist at all visits. Subjects completed the baseline skin care
      regimen questionnaire at visit 1. Hydration assessments were competed at visits 1, 2, and 3.
      A subject satisfaction questionnaire was completed at visit 3. Adverse event assessments
      were conducted for all subjects at every clinic visit after informed consent/assent was
      signed.

    <measure>Barrier Function (TEWL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Barrier function was assessed by measuring transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at  visit 1 (day 1), visit 2 (day 8), and visit 3 (day 22). TEWL measures water loss through the epidermis (for example, by evaporation). Measuring TEWL is a well-established way to assess the skin's water-barrier function. High TEWL values indicate impaired skin barrier function; low values indicate normal barrier function.</description>

    <measure>Hydration (Corneometry)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Hydration was assessed using corneometry at visit 1 (day 1), visit 2 (day 8), and visit 3 (day 22). Corneometry measures the hydration status of the skin. An increase in corneometry values indicates an increase in the hydration status of the skin, and vice versa. The test is procedure specific, so results are reported in &quot;arbitrary units.&quot;</description>
