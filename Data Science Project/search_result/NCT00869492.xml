  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using of nadifloxacine 1% cream and
      benzoyl peroxide 5% solution together is more effective than using nadifloxacine alone in
      the treatment of mild to moderate facial acne.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nadifloxacin; a new topical antibiotic for the treatment of acne has recently been marketed
      in our country. Only a few studies on its use and effectiviness could be found in the
      literature. Nadifloxacin may be an alternative to other topical antibiotics and benzoyl
      peroxide or its use along with benzoyl peroxide may be more effective and rational to
      prevent possible future resistance.
