      Acne is one of the most common skin problems in teenagers and adolescents. There are many
      lesser known homoeopathic medicines which have been mentioned in the literature for
      treatment of acne but their potential has not been properly assessed /documented and
      therefore these medicines don't form a part of many prescriptions. As a part of this
      study,efficacy of Lappa Arctium will be studied in the treatment of Acne vulgaris
