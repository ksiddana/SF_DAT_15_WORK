    <textblock>
      This prospective study tested the effects of isotretinoin in a cohort of patients receiving
      standard therapy for acne vulgaris. Subjects completed questionnaires and standardised
      computer based cognitive testing using CANTAB to test for cognitive effects particularly on
      learning and memory. Test were conducted before starting isotretinoin, after 3 months and
      again a month after finishing therapy. This was carried out as a pilot study to

        1. Test the hypothesis that oral isotretinoin, over its 4-month treatment time, will
           result in a decline in learning and memory as measured using the CANTAB series of test.

        2. Generate data for sample size calculation for a larger study to determine the changes
           in memory over time in drug and control group

        3. Test of CANTAB, questionnaires and data collection forms

        4. Select most appropriate outcome measures

        5. Identify therapy sensitive cognitive tasks which would be used in future functional
           brain imaging studies It was not considered to randomise subjects to placebo.
