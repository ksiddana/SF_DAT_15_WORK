      We give subjects topical benzoyl peroxide, a standard first line acne treatment, in a
      container that records when the container is opened and closed. Subjects will simply be
      asked to &quot;return in six weeks to see how well benzoyl peroxide works for them.&quot; Subjects
      initially will not be told that they are participating in a formal study.  When they return
      with their medication, we will seek their informed consent to participate in the study.
      Verbal consent will be obtained at the beginning of the study. There will be no written
      consent obtained until the end of the study. By doing this, subjects will not be aware that
      adherence is being measured. Subjects will not be aware that they are participating in a
      study. Only if they consent would we then collect the medication container and monitor and
      retrieve the adherence data.  If they do not consent, we will not have collected any
      research data on them except baseline acne severity measures which may have been collected
      anyway as part of their clinic treatment.
