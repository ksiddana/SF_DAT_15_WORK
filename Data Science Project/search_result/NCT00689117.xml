  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of CT Gel in
      subjects with acne vulgaris. The hypothesis is that CT Gel is superior to Clindamycin Gel,
      Tretinoin Gel and Vehicle Gel for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT Gel is a fixed-combination product that addresses the multifactorial factors of acne
      vulgaris pathogenesis.  Based on numerous nonclinical pharmacology studies of each active
      ingredient, it is expected that this new product will have three biological actions:  1)
      comedolytic, 2) antimicrobial, and 3) anti-inflammatory.

    <description>Acne lesion counts (inflammatory [papules, pustules, nodules], non-inflammatory [open and closed comedones], and total) were performed on the face of participants. Change from baseline is defined as Week 12 values minus Baseline values. The total lesion count is the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The ISGA is a static (&quot;snap-shot&quot;) evaluation of acne severity performed by an investigator/assessor at every visit.  The ISGA score is measured on a 6-point ordinal scale, where 0=Clear and 5=Very Severe.  Change is calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <description>The SGA score is a global evaluation of acne severity performed by participants at all visits and  measured on a 5-point ordinal scale, where 0=My face is basically free of acne and 5=My face has blackheads and/or whiteheads.  A score of 1=My face has several blackheads and/or whiteheads and small pimples, but there are no tender deep-seated bumps or cysts.</description>

The ISGA score is measured on a 6-point ordinal scale, where 0=Clear and 5=Very Severe.  A score of 1=Skin Almost Clear: rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyper-pigmented, though not pink-red) requiring no futher treatment in the Investigator's opinion.</description>
