    <textblock>
      A study to determine if using Retin-A Micro 0.04% as facial acne treatment in patients ages
      9 to 11 is safe and efficacious.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 100 female and male subjects, aged from 9 to 11 years of age, will be enrolled
      in this randomized, double blind, multi-center study.

      Following satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures, subjects will receive
      either RETIN-A MICRO 0.04% or a color matched gel vehicle for once daily use during the
      12-week treatment period. Subjects will be monitored for safety throughout the study and for
      signs and symptoms of local irritation at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and again at
      study completion, week 12.

      Efficacy will be assessed by facial lesion counts and by utilizing scales for Investigator's
      Global Evaluation of Acne Severity (IGA #1 and IGA #2) and Investigator's Global Assessment
      of Improvement (IGA #3). All efficacy parameters with the exception of IGA #3 will be
      measured at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The Investigator's Global Assessment
      of Improvement (IGA #3) will be done at Week 12 only. At selected sites, photographs will be
      taken at Baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.

    <description>Change from Baseline to Week 12 (Week 12 minus Baseline) in the total non-inflammatory acne lesion count.  Facial acne lesion counts consisted of non-inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions.  The total non-inflammatory acne lesion count is the sum of open and closed comedones, change from Baseline was calculated as the value after Baseline minus the baseline value, and negative changes indicated lesion improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Lesion Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline in Lesion Count by the following categories: Facial acne lesion counts consisted of non-inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions.  Inflammatory lesions were the sum of papules and pustules.  Total lesions were the sum of non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions, plus nodules/cysts.  For each lesion type, change from Baseline was calculated as the value after Baseline minus the baseline value, and negative changes indicated lesion improvement.</description>

The number of participants for which treatment was considered successful was based on 2 criteria: 1) improvement by at least 2 grades from the baseline score, and 2) ratings of clear or almost clear.</description>
