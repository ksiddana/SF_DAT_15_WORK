  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of DRM01B topical in
      healthy volunteers.  Following review of safety data, this study will determine the safety,
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DRM01B Topical Gel in subjects with acne vulgaris

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a study enrolling 6 healthy volunteer subjects followed by 100 subjects
      with acne vulgaris. Safety data from the healthy volunteer stage will be reviewed prior to
      enrolling subjects with acne vulgaris.

      Phase 1 will be an open label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of DRM01B
      Topical Gel.  Six (6) healthy volunteers will be enrolled and apply DRM01B gel for 1 week to
      the face. Adverse events and local tolerability will be assessed at all study visits.

      Phase 2a will be a randomized, vehicle controlled, parallel group study designed to assess
      the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DRM01B topical gel in subjects with
      acne vulgaris.  Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled and treated with study drug for
      12 weeks.

      Safety will be assessed, at specified time points during the study, through adverse events,
      local skin responses, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical
      examination and vital signs.

      Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through lesion counts (e.g., inflammatory,
      noninflammatory) and the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) for acne.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent

          2. Willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          3. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females

          4. Age ≥ 18 years

          5. Clinical diagnosis of facial acne vulgaris defined as:

               -  At least 20 inflammatory lesions

               -  At least 20 non-inflammatory lesions

               -  Investigator Global Assessment of 3 or greater

          6. Willing to refrain from using any treatments, other than the investigational product,
             including antibiotics, for acne present on the face. Topical acne treatments that do
             not have significant or measurable systemic absorption (e.g., benzoyl peroxide,
             salicylic acid) are allowed for treatment of acne of the back, shoulders and chest
             only.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the course of the study,
             or breast-feeding.

          2. Any skin condition which may interfere with the evaluation of safety or of acne
             vulgaris (e.g., rosacea; seborrheic dermatitis; perioral dermatitis;
             corticosteroid-induced acne or folliculitis)

          3. Excessive facial hair that would interfere with diagnosis or assessment of acne
