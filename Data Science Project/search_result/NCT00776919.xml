      of a clindamycin / benzoyl peroxide gel in Subjects with Acne Vulgaris
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator and vehicle-controlled study in subjects
      with acne vulgaris. Approximately 1320 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be
      randomized to 1 of 4 parallel study groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (clindamycin / benzoyl
      peroxide gel:clindamycin gel:BPO gel:vehicle gel).

    <description>During each study visit, trained study personnel at every investigational center assessed the inflammatory (pustules, papules, nodules) and non-inflammatory (open and closed comedones) lesion counts for each participant. Each type of lesion was counted separately; the lesion counts were taken from the face (including forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin). Total lesion counts were calculated as the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts.</description>

Each type of lesion was counted separately; the lesion counts were taken from the face (including forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin). Total lesion counts were calculated as the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 was calculated as the value at Week 12 minus the value at Baseline divided by the Baseline value * 100.</description>

    <description>An AE included, but was not limited to, any clinically significant worsening of a pre-existing condition; an event occurring from overdose (i.e., a dose higher than that indicated in the protocol) of the study product, whether accidental or intentional; an event occurring from abuse (e.g., use for nonstudy reasons) of the study product; or an event that was associated with the discontinuation of the use of the study product.</description>
