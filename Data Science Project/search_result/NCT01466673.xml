  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ethinyl estradiol and
      Norgestimate (EE/NGM) compared to Ethinyl estradiol and Desogestrel (EE/DSG), for treatment
      of female participants with mild to moderate acne vulgaris (pimples).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind (physician does not know the name of the assigned drug) and
      randomized (study drug assigned by chance) study to compare the effectiveness and safety of
      EE/NGM and EE/DSG in female participants using oral contraceptive and have mild to moderate
      acne vulgaris. Tablets of EE/NGM and EE/DSG will be administered orally once daily for 6
      months and will be instructed to visit for evaluation at Month 1, 3 and 6
      post-administration. The efficacy will be evaluated efficacy primarily through total acne
      lesions count, which will be recorded at these evaluation visits. Unused study medications
      will be collected and drug accountability will be documented. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total and Each Type of Acne Lesions Count at Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 1</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Total acne (pimples) lesion (abnormal area of tissue, such as a wound, sore, rash, or boil) count is summation of all lesions which includes all comedones (open and closed), papules, pustules, and nodules. Change from Baseline means lesions at Baseline minus lesions at Month 1. Positive value indicates decrease in lesion count while negative value indicates increase in lesion count.</description>

    <description>Total acne (pimples) lesion (abnormal area of tissue, such as a wound, sore, rash, or boil) count is summation of all lesions which includes all comedones (open and closed), papules, pustules, and nodules. Change from Baseline means lesions at Baseline minus lesions at Month 3. Positive value indicates decrease in lesion count while negative value indicates increase in lesion count.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Total acne (pimples) lesion (abnormal area of tissue, such as a wound, sore, rash, or boil) count is summation of all lesions which includes all comedones (open and closed), papules, pustules, and nodules. Change from Baseline means lesions at Baseline minus lesions at Month 6. Positive value indicates decrease in lesion count while negative value indicates increase in lesion count.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Vaginal Blood Loss at Month 1, 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Vaginal blood loss encompasses spotting and bleeding. Spotting is defined as a bleeding requiring no or at most one sanitary pad per day; however, bleeding requires two or more sanitary pads per day.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Non-Compliant With Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Compliance was assessed by transforming the data of forgotten tablets listed in the diary cards. Number of participants who forgot to take the drug was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Categorical Score for Sebum Assessment at Month 1, 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 1, 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Sebum assessment that is facial seborrhea (very oily skin) was assessed using sebutape strip on the forehead. Percentage of participants with facial seborrhea were assessed using categorical scores ranging from level 1 (lowest) to level 5 (highest). Highest level indicates worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Showing Treatment Response on the Investigator's Global Assessment at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Percentage of participants showing treatment response on the Investigator's global assessment was graded on a 5-point scale as 0=worse, 1=no change, 2=fair, 3=good, and 4=excellent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Response at the End-of-Therapy by Participant's Self-Assessment at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participant's self-assessment at end-of-therapy was measured by using the self-assessment questionnaire which included 3 questions, about the rating of acne improvement since start of study; comparison of this acne treatment with the one used in past and the continuity of treatment on physician's prescription to evaluate efficacy and acceptability of the study medication. The score was graded at 4 parameters as excellent, better, no change and worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Blood Pressure (BP) at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Blood pressure is the pressure of blood flowing through blood vessels. Change from Baseline in blood pressure is the value at Month 6 minus value at Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
