  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study, that will follow participants over their course of treatment on
      Isotretinoin.  All patients who are prescribed Isotretinoin for their acne treatment are
      registered in iPLEDGE.  The iPLEDGE program involves a set of steps that the patient,
      physician and pharmacist must follow for the patient to take Isotretinoin.  Patients will be
      asked if they are willing to participate in this research study to determine musculoskeletal
      changes in adolescents and young adults on systemic therapy using the highly sensitive
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging modality.  In addition to the MRI, participants will be
      asked if they are willing to give an extra sample of blood when their routine blood work is
      being done for iPLEDGE. This blood sample will be used to determine if there are any effects
      of isotretinoin on bone turnover markers.

        All subjects will be recruited from the UW-Madison, Department of Dermatology located at 1
        South Park Street, Madison, Wisconsin.  Study flyers and brochures will be posted in the
        waiting areas and clinic rooms at the UW Dermatology clinics.  UW Dermatologist will
        identify patients that meet study criteria and ask if they are interested in research
        participation, then they will be referred to study personnel for more information.
