      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two marketed products in
      subjects with facial acne vulgaris
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple physiopathological factors have been associated with acne vulgaris.  Drug
      combinations are frequently used to address these factors and to improve efficacy in the
      treatment of acne. The current study proposes to compare a fixed-dose (once-daily)
      combination gel product containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO)and clindamycin against a
      fixed-dose (once-daily) combination gel product containing BPO and adapalene for the
      treatment of facial acne vulgaris.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females 12 to 45 years of age, inclusive, in good general health.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             baseline.  Sexually active women of childbearing potential participating in the study
             must use a medically acceptable form of contraception

          -  Subjects who have been treated with estrogens, androgens, or anti-androgenic agents
             for more than 12 consecutive weeks prior to the first dose of study product are
             allowed to enroll as long as they do not expect to change dose, drug, or discontinue
             use during the study.

          -  The ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled
             visits, and successfully complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or who are lactating.

          -  Any clinically relevant finding at their baseline physical examination or medical
             history such as severe systemic diseases or diseases of the facial skin other than
             acne vulgaris.

          -  Facial hair that may obscure the accurate assessment of acne grade.

          -  History or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (eg,
             ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, or a history of
             antibiotic-associated colitis) or similar symptoms.

          -  Used topical antibiotics on the face or systemic antibiotics within the past 2 and 4
             weeks, respectively.

          -  Used topical corticosteroids on the face or systemic corticosteroids within the past
             4 weeks.  Use of inhaled, intra articular or intra-lesional (other than for facial
             acne lesions) steroids is acceptable.

          -  Used systemic retinoids within the past 6 months.

          -  Using drugs known to be photosensitizers (eg, thiazides, tetracyclines,
             fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of
             increased phototoxicity.

          -  Using neuromuscular blocking agents.  Clindamycin has neuromuscular blocking
             activities, which may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents.

          -  Used topical anti-acne medications (eg, BPO, retinoids, azelaic acid, resorcinol,
             salicylates, sulfacetamide sodium and derivatives, glycolic acid) within the past 2
             weeks.

          -  Used any investigational therapy within 4 weeks of study day 1.

          -  Using the following types of facial products: astringents, toners, abradants,
             facials, peels containing glycolic or other acids, masks, washes or soaps containing
             BPO, sulfacetamide sodium or salicylic acid, non-mild facial cleansers, or
             moisturizers that contain retinol, salicylic acid, or α- or β-hydroxy acids.

          -  Using medications that are reported to exacerbate acne (eg, mega-doses of certain
             vitamins such as vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamins B2, B6, and B12; haloperidol;
             halogens such as iodide and bromide; lithium; hydantoin; and phenobarbital) as these
             may impact efficacy assessments.

          -  Have had a facial procedure (chemical or laser peel, microdermabrasion, artificial
             ultraviolet [UV] therapy) performed by an esthetician, beautician, physician, nurse,
             or other practitioner, within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any of the active
             components, lincomycin, adapalene, clindamycin, BPO, or excipients of the study
             medication.

          -  Employees of a clinical research organization involved in the study, or Stiefel
             Laboratories, or an immediate family member (partner, offspring, parents, siblings,
             or sibling's offspring) of an employee.

          -  Have a member of the same household in this trial.
