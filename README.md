<b>Risk of Diabetes</b><br>
Can we predict the risk of developing diabetes based on family history, sugar level, heart rate, dna data from 23&me, weight gain/loss, blood pressure, pH levels? How much of diabetes is related to genetic versus unhealthy eating/lifestyle habits? 

<u>Validating the Data</u>
What did the past patients of diabetes eventually die off? What was their estimated life expectancy? How much was their Blood Sugar level when they passed away? 

<u>Conclusion</u>
Can we reduce the risk of developing diabetes based on the collected data above for individuals that are highly likely to develop diabetes?
