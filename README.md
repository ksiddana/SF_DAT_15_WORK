<b>Risk of Diabetes</b><br>
Can we predict the risk of developing diabetes based on family history, sugar level, heart rate, dna data from 23&me, weight gain/loss, blood pressure, pH levels? How much of diabetes is related to genetic versus unhealthy eating/lifestyle habits? 

<p><b>Validating the Data</b><br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>What was their estimated life expectancy of the patients with Past Medical Record?</li>
<li>How much was their Blood Sugar level when they passed away?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
Can we reduce the risk of developing diabetes based on the collected data above for individuals that are highly likely to develop diabetes?
